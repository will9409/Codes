int x;  // we want to find the minimum of x and y
int y;   
int r;  // the result goes here 

r = y ^ ((x ^ y) & -(x < y)); // min(x, y)

On some rare machines where branching is very expensive and no condition move instructions exist, the above expression might 
be faster than the obvious approach, r = (x < y) ? x : y, even though it involves two more instructions. (Typically, the 
obvious approach is best, though.) It works because if x < y, then -(x < y) will be all ones,
so r = y ^ (x ^ y) & ~0 = y ^ x ^ y = x. Otherwise, if x >= y, then -(x < y) will be all zeros, so r = y ^ ((x ^ y) & 0) = y.
On some machines, evaluating (x < y) as 0 or 1 requires a branch instruction, so there may be no advantage.

To find the maximum, use:

r = x ^ ((x ^ y) & -(x < y)); // max(x, y)

Quick and dirty versions:
If you know that INT_MIN <= x - y <= INT_MAX, then you can use the following, which are faster because (x - y) only needs to 
be evaluated once.

r = y + ((x - y) & ((x - y) >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1))); // min(x, y)
r = x - ((x - y) & ((x - y) >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1))); // max(x, y)

Note that the 1989 ANSI C specification doesn't specify the result of signed right-shift, so these aren't portable. If 
exceptions are thrown on overflows, then the values of x and y should be unsigned or cast to unsigned for the subtractions to 
avoid unnecessarily throwing an exception, however the right-shift needs a signed operand to produce all one bits when 
negative, so cast to signed there.

On March 7, 2003, Angus Duggan pointed out the right-shift portability issue. On May 3, 2005, Randal E. Bryant alerted me to 
the need for the precondition, INT_MIN <= x - y <= INT_MAX, and suggested the non-quick and dirty version as a fix. Both of 
these issues concern only the quick and dirty version. Nigel Horspoon observed on July 6, 2005 that gcc produced the same 
code on a Pentium as the obvious solution because of how it evaluates (x < y). On July 9, 2008 Vincent Lefèvre pointed out 
the potential for overflow exceptions with subtractions in r = y + ((x - y) & -(x < y)), which was the previous version. 
Timothy B. Terriberry suggested using xor rather than add and subract to avoid casting and the risk of overflows on June 2, 
2009.
