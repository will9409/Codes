unsigned int a;    // value to merge in non-masked bits
unsigned int b;    // value to merge in masked bits
unsigned int mask; // 1 where bits from b should be selected; 0 where from a.
unsigned int r;    // result of (a & ~mask) | (b & mask) goes here

r = a ^ ((a ^ b) & mask); 

This shaves one operation from the obvious way of combining two sets of bits according to a bit mask. 
If the mask is a constant, then there may be no advantage.
