bool f;         // conditional flag
unsigned int m; // the bit mask
unsigned int w; // the word to modify:  if (f) w |= m; else w &= ~m; 

w ^= (-f ^ w) & m;

// OR, for superscalar CPUs:
w = (w & ~m) | (-f & m);

On some architectures, the lack of branching can more than make up for what appears to be twice as many operations. 
For instance, informal speed tests on an AMD Athlonâ„¢ XP 2100+ indicated it was 5-10% faster. An Intel Core 2 Duo ran the 
superscalar version about 16% faster than the first. Glenn Slayden informed me of the first expression on December 11, 2003.
Marco Yu shared the superscalar version with me on April 3, 2007 and alerted me to a typo 2 days later.
