Compute the sign of an integer

int v;      // we want to find the sign of v
int sign;   // the result goes here 

// CHAR_BIT is the number of bits per byte (normally 8).
sign = -(v < 0);  // if v < 0 then -1, else 0. 
// or, to avoid branching on CPUs with flag registers (IA32):
sign = -(int)((unsigned int)((int)v) >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));
// or, for one less instruction (but not portable):
sign = v >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1); 

The last expression above evaluates to sign = v >> 31 for 32-bit integers. This is one operation faster than the obvious way,
sign = -(v < 0). This trick works because when signed integers are shifted right, the value of the far left bit is 
copied to the other bits. The far left bit is 1 when the value is negative and 0 otherwise; all 1 bits gives -1.
Unfortunately, this behavior is architecture-specific.

Alternatively, if you prefer the result be either -1 or +1, then use:

sign = +1 | (v >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));  // if v < 0 then -1, else +1

On the other hand, if you prefer the result be either -1, 0, or +1, then use:

sign = (v != 0) | -(int)((unsigned int)((int)v) >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));
// Or, for more speed but less portability:
sign = (v != 0) | (v >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));  // -1, 0, or +1
// Or, for portability, brevity, and (perhaps) speed:
sign = (v > 0) - (v < 0); // -1, 0, or +1

If instead you want to know if something is non-negative, resulting in +1 or else 0, then use:

sign = 1 ^ ((unsigned int)v >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1)); // if v < 0 then 0, else 1

Caveat: On March 7, 2003, Angus Duggan pointed out that the 1989 ANSI C specification leaves the result of signed
right-shift implementation-defined, so on some systems this hack might not work. For greater portability, Toby Speight
suggested on September 28, 2005 that CHAR_BIT be used here and throughout rather than assuming bytes were 8 bits long. 
Angus recommended the more portable versions above, involving casting on March 4, 2006. Rohit Garg suggested the version 
for non-negative integers on September 12, 2009.
