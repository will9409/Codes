The following finds the the rank of a bit, meaning it returns the sum of bits that are set to 1 from the most-signficant bit
downto the bit at the given position.

  uint64_t v;       // Compute the rank (bits set) in v from the MSB to pos.
  unsigned int pos; // Bit position to count bits upto.
  uint64_t r;       // Resulting rank of bit at pos goes here.

  // Shift out bits after given position.
  r = v >> (sizeof(v) * CHAR_BIT - pos);
  // Count set bits in parallel.
  // r = (r & 0x5555...) + ((r >> 1) & 0x5555...);
  r = r - ((r >> 1) & ~0UL/3);
  // r = (r & 0x3333...) + ((r >> 2) & 0x3333...);
  r = (r & ~0UL/5) + ((r >> 2) & ~0UL/5);
  // r = (r & 0x0f0f...) + ((r >> 4) & 0x0f0f...);
  r = (r + (r >> 4)) & ~0UL/17;
  // r = r % 255;
  r = (r * (~0UL/255)) >> ((sizeof(v) - 1) * CHAR_BIT);

Juha JÃ¤rvi sent this to me on November 21, 2009 as an inverse operation to the computing the bit position with the given rank,
which follows.
