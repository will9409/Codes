 Conditionally negate a value without branching
If you need to negate only when a flag is false, then use the following to avoid branching:

bool fDontNegate;  // Flag indicating we should not negate v.
int v;             // Input value to negate if fDontNegate is false.
int r;             // result = fDontNegate ? v : -v;

r = (fDontNegate ^ (fDontNegate - 1)) * v;

If you need to negate only when a flag is true, then use this:

bool fNegate;  // Flag indicating if we should negate v.
int v;         // Input value to negate if fNegate is true.
int r;         // result = fNegate ? -v : v;

r = (v ^ -fNegate) + fNegate;

Avraham Plotnitzky suggested I add the first version on June 2, 2009. Motivated to avoid the multiply, I came up with the 
second version on June 8, 2009. Alfonso De Gregorio pointed out that some parens were missing on November 26, 2009, and 
received a bug bounty.
