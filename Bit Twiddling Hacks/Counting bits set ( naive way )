unsigned int v; // count the number of bits set in v
unsigned int c; // c accumulates the total bits set in v

for (c = 0; v; v >>= 1)
{
  c += v & 1;
}

The naive approach requires one iteration per bit, until no more bits are set. So on a 32-bit word with only the high set, 
it will go through 32 iterations.
