unsigned int v;       // word value to compute the parity of
bool parity = false;  // parity will be the parity of v

while (v)
{
  parity = !parity;
  v = v & (v - 1);
}

The above code uses an approach like Brian Kernigan's bit counting, above. The time it takes is proportional to the number of
bits set.
